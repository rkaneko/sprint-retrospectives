# Why do we need retrospectives?

- The best thing is no problems occur, but we're sometimes faced with problems.

- Processes need gradual improvement for adapting to environment's changes.
  - A new member joins to/leaves from our team.
  - We cannot have a perfect process from the beginning.

- Team is like a car.
  - When there is something wrong with the car, we should inspect and repair it.
  - **We need sometimes .color-yellow[stop periodically].**

## Ice breaking

- .color-yellow[**Enhance psychological safety!**]
  - Ensure the place where everyone can be relieved to speak anything.
  - Don't be offensive.
  - <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> Alice vs. Bob
  - <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> Problems vs. team

- There is not any kind of hierarchical relationship.
  - We're the team!
  - <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> That's .color-green[**your**] fault.
  - <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> That's .color-yellow[**our**] fault.

- Every member should understand what we do at our retrospective.
  - The facilitator should describe it at the beginning.

## Collecting data

- Collect our product's metrics .color-yellow[regularly] (.color-yellow[quantitative] data)
  - burn up chart
  - story points (velocity)
  - test coverage
  - the number of bugs, interruption tasks, system faults etc

- Collect our .color-yellow[qualitative] data using a methodology
  - KPT, Happiness radar, Timeline etc

- Collected data helps for members to understand their team situation and to discuss effectively using them.

### KPT (Keep Problem Try)

- .color-orange[Keep] means good points which improves us or helps us on this sprint.
  - <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> .color-grey[`Pair programming with Marco enhanced my coding because I don't have much space knowledgement.`]

- .color-orange[Problem] means not good points which is troublesome for your/our work.
  - <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> with [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)
  - <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> Writing things which are difficult to improve or we cannot find a good solutions for.
  - <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> .color-grey[`There was difference between the function we implemented and what product owner expected because blahblah.`]

- .color-orange[Try] means what we should do to improve a problem and to prevent a problem to occur again.
  - <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> .color-grey[`Let's start to study prototyping with product owner using Adobe XD.`]

## Bringing ideas together

- Extract root causes using collected data & facts.
  - <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> 5 Whys
  - Distinguish .color-yellow[facts] and .color-yellow[opinions]

- Set up a hypothesis.

- Design next actions.
---
### More detail problem

- When .color-pink[**[Situation]**] I want to .color-pink[**[Motivation]**] so I can .color-pink[**[Expected Outcome]**].

- For better format
  - In 'when part', .color-pink[**adding context**] to situation concretely
  - -> Understanding its context enables you to design its solution effectively
  - .color-pink[**Adding forces**] to motivations
  - -> We can design its solution to reduce forces of motivations

### e.g. Amazon [Mayday](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/press/pr/201409181/) feature

- When I’m using my tablet and encounter a problem
…
- [Motivation] I want to get help right away…

- [Force] I’m irritated because I was in the middle of something…

- [Solution] Reassure that customers don’t have to wait long to get help. ( I’m nervous I won’t finish what I was just doing )

- [Force] I get nervous asking for help…

- [Solution] Remind customers how common it is to ask for help. (Asking for help might make me look stupid)

## Making a decision what we do next

- We have limited time.

- Cannot do everything to improve.

- Prioritize what we should do next.
  - You can use [fist-to-five](http://agileforall.com/learning-with-fist-of-five-voting/).

- Decide .color-yellow[**who**] does .color-yellow[**what**] .color-yellow[**by when**].
